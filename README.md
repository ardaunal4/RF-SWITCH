# RF-SWITCH

In this project, we aimed to create pulses from an RF power source. We used HMC544A RF Switch Module. I programmed the STM32F103C8T6 development board for USB 
communication and PWM. Additionally, I created a GUI to control STM32 via computer. Therefore users can set PWM frequency and duty cycle via this GUI remotely. 
I also designed a carrier PCB with the modules mentioned above and a power supply section.
